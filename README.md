<b>Abstract</b>
<br>
	The availability of large datasets of information or big data provides several opportunities in the field of eating disorders. The current study analyzed a large dataset of 8651 documents (since 1981 to 2020), from top leading journals: International Journal of Eating Disorders (n = 4185, 48.38%), Eating and Weight Disorders (n = 1540, 17.80%), European Eating Disorders Review (n = 1461, 16.88%), Eating Disorders (n = 1072, 12.39%), and the Journal of Eating Disorders (n = 393, 4.54%). Diverse methodologies were employed: bibliometrics (to identify top cited documents), network analysis (to identify most representative scholars and collaboration networks), and topic modeling (to retrieve major topics using text mining, natural language processing, and machine learning algorithms). The results showed that the most cited documents were related to instruments used for the screening and evaluation of eating disorders, followed by review articles related to the epidemiology, course, and outcome of eating disorders. Network analysis identified well renowned scholars in the field, as well as their collaboration networks. Finally, topic modeling identified 10 major topics whereas a time series analysis of these topics identified relevant historical shifts. This study discusses the results in terms of future opportunities in the field of eating disorders, particularly related to the use of novel methodologies and technologies for the advancement of science.
